# Local GraphRAG Knowledge Base

> A self‑hosted, **fully offline** GraphRAG system — paste text, build a knowledge graph, ask grounded questions. Nothing ever leaves your machine.

Paste any text into the web UI and it's chunked, embedded, and turned into a **knowledge
graph** in Neo4j. Ask a question and a **local LLM (Ollama)** answers it — grounded only in
what you added, using both semantic (vector) search and one‑hop graph expansion.

> **Proof of concept** — the full _ingest → graph → retrieve → answer_ loop, runnable with a
> single `docker compose up`.

## The app

A React + Material UI front end with four tabs.

### Add knowledge

Paste any text — it's chunked, embedded, and an entity/relationship graph is extracted into Neo4j.

![Add knowledge tab](docs/img/add-knowledge.png)

### Ask

Your question is embedded, matched against stored chunks (hybrid vector + keyword) **and against
entities directly** (entity-anchored "local search"), expanded over the graph, and answered by the
local LLM — with expandable **sources** (passages + graph facts).

![Ask tab](docs/img/ask.png)

_The app starts empty — the answer above is grounded in documents that were ingested first
(the stats bar reflects that). You build the knowledge base with your own text._

### Knowledge graph

Interactive [Cytoscape](https://js.cytoscape.org/) view of the extracted entities (coloured
by type) and their relationships. Drag nodes, scroll to zoom, refresh after ingesting.

![Knowledge graph tab](docs/img/knowledge-graph.png)

### Settings

Live‑tune the RAG pipeline — chunk size / overlap, top‑K, max extraction characters, and the
entity‑extraction toggle. Changes apply immediately.

## Quick start

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

| Service       | URL                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Web UI**    | http://localhost:3000                           |
| Neo4j Browser | http://localhost:7474 (`neo4j` / `password123`) |
| Backend API   | http://localhost:8000/api/health                |

First run downloads ~2.5 GB of Ollama models — wait for `RAG backend ready.` in the logs,
then open the UI. CPU works; a GPU is much faster (uncomment the `deploy` block for `ollama`
in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)).

> **Behind a corporate proxy / antivirus** and the build or model pull fails with SSL
> errors? See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

---

## Architecture

Five services, wired by Docker Compose (a one-shot `ollama-init` pulls the models, then
exits). The Flask backend follows **clean architecture** (dependencies point inward to the
domain). **Neo4j** is both the vector store and the knowledge graph; **Ollama** serves the
local chat and embedding models.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/img/architecture.png" alt="System architecture" width="880"></p>

Internally it's a **ports & adapters** (hexagonal) design: the domain core depends only on
interfaces; the Ollama and Neo4j adapters implement them, so every dependency points inward.

Deep dive — clean‑architecture rationale, the Neo4j schema, and the GraphRAG sophistication
ladder: **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

---

## How it works

Neo4j does double duty: it stores **chunk embeddings** (a native vector index) _and_ an
**entity/relationship graph**. Retrieval is therefore **hybrid** — semantic vector search
finds relevant passages, the query is also matched against **entity embeddings** to find
relevant entities directly, and a one‑hop graph traversal then pulls in connected facts that
plain vector RAG would miss.

### Creating knowledge

`text → chunk → embed (Ollama) → extract + summarize graph per chunk (Ollama) → embed entities → store in Neo4j`

<p align="center"><img src="docs/img/flow-ingest.png" alt="Knowledge-creation sequence" width="880"></p>

### Answering a question

`question → embed (Ollama) → hybrid search + LLM rerank → entity & graph expansion → grounded answer (Ollama)`

Env vars set the **startup defaults** (copy [.env.template](.env.template) to `.env`); the
chunking/retrieval ones are then editable at runtime from the **Settings** tab.

| Variable                       | Default            | Meaning                               |

| `EMBEDDING_MODEL`              | `nomic-embed-text` | Ollama embedding model                |
| `EMBEDDING_DIM`                | `768`              | Must match the embedding model        |
| `CHUNK_SIZE` / `CHUNK_OVERLAP` | `800` / `100`      | Chunking window (characters)          |
| `TOP_K`                        | `5`                | Chunks retrieved per question         |
| `ENABLE_ENTITY_EXTRACTION`     | `true`             | Off = plain vector RAG, faster ingest |

> Changing `EMBEDDING_MODEL` changes the vector dimension — update `EMBEDDING_DIM` to match
> and reset the knowledge base; old and new vectors aren't comparable.

<summary><b>Troubleshooting</b></summary>

**SSL certificate errors behind a TLS-inspecting proxy.** Your host trusts the proxy's
root CA, but the containers don't. Two phases, fixed separately:

1. **Image build** (pip/npm `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`) → set `INSECURE_TLS=1` in `.env`.
2. **Ollama model pull** (`x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`) → Ollama must
   _trust_ the CA. Export your roots into [certs/](certs/):
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File certs\export-windows-cas.ps1
   ```
   (See [certs/README.md](certs/README.md) for non-Windows.) Then `docker compose up --build`.

On a normal network neither step is needed.

**Backend retries Neo4j on first boot** — expected; Neo4j takes ~30 s to become healthy.

**First question is slow** — the LLM loads into memory on the first call; later calls are
faster (a GPU helps a lot).

## Roadmap

Baseline GraphRAG + entity extraction is done. Next, in order of value:

- [x] **Graph visualisation** in the UI (interactive Cytoscape view).
- [x] **Hybrid search** — union the vector and full-text indexes.
- [ ] **Text2Cypher** — route counting/aggregation questions to generated Cypher.
- [ ] **Entity resolution** — merge duplicates ("ACME" / "ACME Ltd").
- [ ] **Community summaries** (Microsoft-style GraphRAG) for broad corpus questions.
