Extract a knowledge graph from the text below.

Return JSON with exactly this shape:
{{
  "entities": [

  ],
  "relationships": [
    {{"source": "<entity name>", "target": "<entity name>", "type": "<UPPER_SNAKE_CASE verb>", "description": "<short description>"}}

Rules:
- Use concise, canonical entity names (e.g. "Marie Curie", not "she").
- Every relationship's source and target MUST appear in the entities list.
- Prefer 5-20 of the most important entities; do not invent facts.
- If nothing meaningful can be extracted, return empty lists.

Example
Text:
\"\"\"
Ada Lovelace wrote the first algorithm for the Analytical Engine, a mechanical
computer designed by Charles Babbage.
\"\"\"
